## Public code from publications
{: .fw-700}

Many of my publications have open-source public code associated with them. You can find links to repositories that I've made major contributions below.

- ### [***MLHAD***] (***[2203.04983](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.04983)***, ***2310.xxxxx***)
><details><summary><strong><em>Summary</em></strong></summary>
  Hadronization is the process by which colored partons (quarks, anti-quarks, and gluons) are converted into colorless composite objects known as hadrons (protons, neutrons, pions, etc.). MLHAD is a machine-learning-based project developing generative machine learning algoirthms and training paradigms to improve phenomenological models of hadronization used by event generators that simulate high energy collision events. 

- ### [***EMD4CPV***] (***[2301.13211](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13211)***)
><details><summary><strong><em>Summary</em></strong></summary>
  Charge-Parity (CP) violation in many-body weak meson decays manifests as local density asymmetries on kinematic (phase-space) graphs known as Dalitz plots. EMD4CPV is software library that provides a simple interface to create  optimal-transport observables based on the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) that are sensitive to these density asymmetries.
