### [***MLHAD***] (***[2203.04983](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.04983)***, ***[2311.09296](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09296)***, ***[2410.06342](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06342)***)

  Hadronization is the process by which colored partons (quarks, anti-quarks, and gluons) are converted into colorless composite objects known as hadrons (protons, neutrons, pions, etc.). MLHAD is an ongoing research project developing generative machine learning algorithms and training paradigms to improve phenomenological models of hadronization that are widely used in high energy collision event simulations i.e. general-purpose Monte Carlo event generators such as [Pythia](https://pythia.org/latest-manual/Welcome.html). 

### [***EMD4CPV***] (***[2301.13211](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13211)***)
><details><summary><strong><em>Summary</em></strong></summary>
  Charge-Parity (CP) violation in many-body weak meson decays manifests as local density asymmetries on kinematic (phase-space) graphs known as Dalitz plots. EMD4CPV is a software library that provides a simple interface for the implementation of optimal-transport-based observables utilizing the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD). These observables are sensitive to density asymmetries and thus also sensitive to CP violation within the Dalitz plot.

### [***MuonBridge***] (***[2406.13818](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13818)***)
><details><summary><strong><em>Summary</em></strong></summary>
  MuonBridge is a top-level repository to a numerical EFT software suite that, through an effective theory tower, facilitates the matching of charged-lepton-flavor-violating (CLFV) Standard Model extensions to a recently developed nonrelativistic effective theory (NRET) that describes the nuclear-level interactions of muon-to-electron conversion within the field of a nucleus. This allows for the theoretical prediction of conversion rates and capture ratios within arbitrary CLFV UV completions that can be compared with experimental measurements.
