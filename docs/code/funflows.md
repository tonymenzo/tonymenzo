***Title***: Functional renormalization group and coupling flows

***Summary***: A symbolic and numerical software library that implements  funcitonal renormalization group methods to compute the beta-functions and fixed-points of a O(N)-symmetric scalar field theories (N is an arbitray integer representing the number of scalar fields in the theory).
