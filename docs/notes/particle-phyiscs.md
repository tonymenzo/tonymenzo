# **Particle Physics**
{: .fw-700}

High energy physics phenomenology largely revolves around the ability to make precise mathematical predictions for high energy experimental measurements. For collision-based experiments, these predictions typically stem from *cross-section* and *decay-rate* computations. Roughly speaking, the cross section and decay rate of a process tells us how *probable* or *likely* an interaction is between two 'states' - characterized by their properties before- and after- the collision/decay (cross-sections are typically associated with multi-particle initial and final states where as decay-rates are associated with single- to multi- particle initial and final states). These quantities are measured and reported explicitly by experiments and most importantly, can be computed theoretically using the mathematical tools of quantum field theory.
