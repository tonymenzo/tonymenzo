## Summary

My current research focuses on the exploration of computational methods in high energy physics phenomenology. Specifically on applications of machine learning and optimal-transport-based algorithms in Monte Carlo event generation and charge-parity (CP) observables as well as the development of effective field theory simulations. Additionally I'm very interested in applications of 'top-down' phenomenology involving the tools of gauge/gravity correspondence. Applications to QCD and confining gauge theories exhibiting cascading (tumbling) or walking behavior are of particular interest.

## Completed Projects

"***Modeling hadronization using machine learning***" - ***[2203.04983](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.04983)*** - Authors: Ahmed Youssef, Phil Ilten, *Tony Menzo*, and Jure Zupan
><details><summary><strong><em>Abstract</em></strong></summary> 
We present the first steps in the development of a new class of hadronization models utilizing machine learning techniques. We successfully implement, validate, and train a conditional sliced-Wasserstein autoencoder to replicate the Pythia generated kinematic distributions of first-hadron emissions, when the Lund string model of hadronization implemented in Pythia is restricted to the emissions of pions only. The trained models are then used to generate the full hadronization chains, with an IR cutoff energy imposed externally. The hadron multiplicities and cumulative kinematic distributions are shown to match the Pythia generated ones. We also discuss possible future generalizations of our results.

 

"***On the implications of positive W mass shift***" - ***[2204.05992](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.05992)*** - Authors: Reuven Balkin, Eric Madge, *Tony Menzo*, Yotam Soreq, Gilad Perez, and Jure Zupan
><details><summary><strong><em>Abstract</em></strong></summary> 
We investigate the phenomenological implications of the recent W mass measurement by the CDF collaboration, which exhibits tension with the standard model (SM) electroweak fit. Performing the fit to the electroweak observables within the SM effective field theory, we find that the new physics that contributes either to the determination of the electroweak vacuum expectation value, or to the oblique parameters, can improve the agreement with data. The best description is obtained from a fit where flavor universality is not required in the new physics operators, with 2 to 3 Ïƒ indications for several nonzero Wilson coefficients. We point out that top partners with order TeV masses could lead to the observed shift in the W mass.

"***The Earth Mover's Distance as a Measure of CP Violation***" - ***[2301.13211](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13211)*** - Authors: Adam Davis, *Tony Menzo*, Ahmed Youssef, and Jure Zupan
><details><summary><strong><em>Abstract</em></strong></summary> 
We introduce a new unbinned two sample test statistic sensitive to CP violation utilizing the optimal transport plan associated with the Wasserstein (earth mover's) distance. The efficacy of the test statistic is shown via two examples of CP asymmetric distributions with varying sample sizes: the Dalitz distributions of $B^0\rightarrow K^+\pi^-\pi^0$ and  of $'D^0 \rightarrow \pi^+\pi^-\pi^0'$ decays. The windowed version of the Wasserstein distance test statistic is shown to have comparable sensitivity to CP violation as the commonly used energy test statistic, but also retains information about the localized distributions of CP asymmetry over the Dalitz plot. For large statistic datasets we introduce two modified Wasserstein distance based test statistics --- the binned and the sliced Wasserstein distance statistics, which show comparable sensitivity to CP violation, but  improved computing time and memory scalings. Finally, general extensions and applications of the introduced statistics are discussed.
